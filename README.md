![Cats and Dogs](https://storage.googleapis.com/mledu-datasets/cats_and_dogs_filtered.zip)

## Project Description

This project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based image classifier that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs. The dataset used is the "Cats and Dogs Filtered" dataset, which is a subset of the larger dataset available from Microsoft.

## Features

- Data Augmentation for better generalization
- Multiple Convolutional and Pooling Layers for feature extraction
- Dense Layers with Dropout for classification
- Model Performance Visualization (Accuracy and Loss)

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 2,000 training images (1,000 from each class) and 1,000 validation images (500 from each class). You can download the dataset from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/mledu-datasets/cats_and_dogs_filtered.zip).
